-   Create an agenda
    -   Include timings
    -   Plan to run for 25 or 50 minutes
-   Have clear rules for making decisions
-   Have a moderator
    -   Call on specific people
    -   One point at a time
    -   No interruptions or side conversations
-   Establish meeting protocol
    -   "Are we chatting in Zoom, on Slack, or in the Google Doc?"
    -   "How do I raise my hand?"
-   Take notes
    -   So people who werenâ€™t there know what happened
    -   So people who were there agree what happened
    -   So people can be held accountable at later meetings
    -   "Notes" may take the form of updated tickets
-   Status, then decisions
    -   First lap: three-sentence rule
    -   Sort issues by priority and discuss in order
    -   Progress, plans, and problems go in
    -   Context and priorities come out
